The objective of this project is to create an interactive and visually appealing bar chart using D3.js, a powerful JavaScript library for producing dynamic and data-driven visualizations in the web browser.

Project Overview
The goal is to represent a dataset as a bar chart where the length of each bar is proportional to its value. Each bar will display its corresponding value and include interactive elements such as smooth transitions and hover effects to enhance the user experience.
